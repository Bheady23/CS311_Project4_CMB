            Richard Wagner (1813 - 1883)<br>
            ============================<br>
            <br>
            Richard Wagner was born in Venice on May 22, 1813. As a youth, he<br>
            studied music in Leipzig. His first opera, "Die Feen" was written at the<br>
            age of 20, in 1833. This was followed in 1836 with the unsuccessful<br>
            "Das Liebesverbot". That same year, Wagner married the actress Minna<br>
            Planer. Wagner and his family lived for a few years in Königsberg, and<br>
            then later, in Riga. While in Paris from 1839 to 1842, he composed the<br>
            grand opera, "Rienzi," and the tragedy, "Der Fliegende Holländer."<br>
            <br>    
            The success of "Rienzi" led to Wagner's appointment as music director in<br>
            Dresden. More successes followed with "Tannhäuser" in 1845 and "Lohengrin"<br>
            in 1850. However, at the same time, Wagner became involved with political<br>
            radicals. He was forced to Switzerland after his participation in the <br>
            1849 Dresden uprisings.<br>
            <br>    
            In exile, Wagner began work on his four opera cycle, "Der Ring des <br>
            Nibelungen," which occupied much of his life. Taking time off from his <br>
            work on the "Ring", Wagner composed the romantic tragedy, "Tristan und<br>
            Isolde." The opera, "Die Meistersinger" followed a few years later. This<br>
            opera is notorious for the anti-Semitic expressions of the protagonist.<br>
            <br>
            In 1860, he was allowed to return to Germany. A triumphant performance of <br>
            "Tannhäuser" in Paris confirmed Wagner's stature as international artist of <br>
            great renown. <br>
            <br>
            Finally in 1876, the "Ring" premiered in Bayreuth. The strain of raising<br>
            money and getting the production ready greatly affected Wagner's health.<br>
            His final opera, "Parsifal," was presented at the second Bayreuth festival<br>
            in 1882.<br>
            <br>
            Wagner died on February 13th, 1883 at the age of 69. <br>
