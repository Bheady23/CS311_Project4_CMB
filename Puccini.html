            Giacomo Puccini (1858 - 1924)<br>
            ============================<br>

            Giacomo Puccini was born on December 22, 1858, to a family of church<br>
            musicians in Lucca. He first studied with his uncle at the Instituto <br>
            Pacini in Lucca, but a performance of Verdi's "Aida" brought forth a love<br>
            for operatic composition. Puccini attended the Milan Conservatory and<br>
            studied under Bazzini and Ponchielli. His first opera, "Le Villi," was<br>
            written in 1884, at the age of 26.<br>
            <br>
            The opera "Edgar," written in 1893, was a failure, but "Manon Lescaut" <br>
            proved to be an international success. More successes followed, including<br>
            three of the most popular operas in history: "La Bohème" (1896), <br>
            "Tosca" (1900), and the incomparable "Madama Butterfly," written in 1904.<br> 
            For each opera, Puccini collaborated with the librettists Illica and<br>
            Giacosa. The successful team broke up with Giacosa's death in 1906.<br>
            <br>    
            Domestic tragedies plagued the rest of Puccini's life. His next opera,<br>
            "The West," did not appear until 1910. Although containing many musical<br>
            and stylistic innovations, this opera has never received the popular<br>
            acclaim of his earlier work.<br>
            <br>
            Puccini's final opera, "Turandot," produced in 1926, is a grand and <br>
            ambitious piece. Sadly, the work was unfinished and the final act had <br>
            to be written by Franco Alfano. The conductor, Leopold Stokowski, later <br>
            refused to conduct the final act; instead, he told the audience, "and <br>
            here the composer laid down his pen." Stokowski then left the stage.<br>
            <br>
            Puccini died on November 29, 1924 in Brussels at the age of 65.<br>
