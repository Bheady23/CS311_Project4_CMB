            Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791)<br>
            ===================================<br>
            <br>
            Born in Salzburg, the son of a composer, Mozart was a musical <br>
            prodigy. From a very early age, his father exhibited him in Paris,<br> 
            Munich, London, and Vienna. From his travels with his father, Mozart was<br>
            exposed to a wide variety of musical styles. From a very early age, <br>
            Mozart showed a mastery of the operatic style. At the age of 12, he <br>
            composed the singspiel, "Bastien and Bastienne," and a year later, the <br>
            opera buffe, "La Finta Semplice."<br>
            <br>
            In 1775, Mozart held an unrewarding position in the Salzburg court. Mozart<br>
            traveled widely with his mother, searching for a more prestigious position,<br>
            but none materialized. While in Munich in 1781, he composed the opera,<br>
            "Idomeneo." He later resigned from his post in Salzburg, taking up <br>
            permanent residence in Vienna in the hopes of becoming a court composer.<br>
            There he married Constanze Weber.<br>
            <br>
            Mozart met with moderate success in Vienna. It was there that he composed<br>
            the singspiel, "Die Entführung aus dem Serail," and the popular "Marriage<br>
            of Figaro." The success of "Figaro" resulted in a commission for "Don<br>
            Giovanni," composed in 1787. Also in that year, Mozart received an<br>
            appointment to the Vienna court. The prestigious appointment did not solve<br>
            Mozart's chronic financial problems. His prospects did not improve either,<br>
            when the unsympathetic Leopold II ascended to the throne.<br>
            <br>
            With his health deteriorating, Mozart composed the opera, "La Clemenza <br>
            di Tito" for the new emperor's coronation. <br>
            <br>
            Mozart died in Vienna in 1791 at the age of 35.<br>
