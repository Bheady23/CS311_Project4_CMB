            Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901)<br>
            ==========================<br>

            Giuseppe Verdi was born in Roncole on October 10th, 1813, the son of a <br>
            tavern keeper. Verdi learned music starting at the age of <br>
            three from a pastor in his village's church using a spinette that Verdi<br>
            owned. The spinette still survives in a museum in Milan.<br>
            <br>
            Verdi's genius was evident from the beginning. He composed instrumental <br>
            religious works, sinfonies, and arias for the Filarmonica di Busseto -<br>
            the philharmonic band located near the village where Verdi grew up.<br>
            <br>
            From very early on, Verdi wanted to be an opera composer. At the beginning <br>
            it was difficult to find a good libretto, and it was almost impossible to <br>
            find a stage to perform the completed work. No theater trusted <br>
            the work of a novice composer. Through hard work and diligence, Verdi<br> 
            eventually experienced modest success with his opera "Oberto" in 1839. <br>
            A few years later in 1842, he had even greater success with "Nabucco." <br>
            The opera, interpreted as a political statement on the oppression of the <br>
            Hebrews, was met with international acclaim.<br>
            <br>
            Even with his first operas, Verdi displayed a captivating new style. <br> 
            His style was bold and subtle in a way that was different from the <br>
            masters of the period like Rossini, Donizzeti and Bellini. Verdi was a<br>
            prolific composer. Within a ten-year period he wrote several operas <br>
            including "Ernani" in 1844 and "MacBeth" in  1847. These operas showcased<br> 
            Verdi's ability to combine character and story alongside his compelling <br>
            music.<br>
            <br>
            Verdi's success continued into the early 1850's with "Rigoletto" in <br>
            1851, "Il Trovatore" in 1853, and, of course, "La Traviata", also in <br>
            1853. Verdi had reached the point where he could refuse commissions, <br>
            instead concentrating only on those tasks that interested him. The <br>
            operas "Don Carlos" in 1867, and "Aida" in 1871, deftly explored the <br>
            conflicts between public and private responsibility.<br>
            <br>
            After retiring to become a gentleman farmer in Sant'Agata near his <br>
            birthplace, Verdi was persuaded to return to composing with the <br>
            opportunity to create an opera based on Shakespeare's "Othello." <br>
            The result, "Otello" in 1887, is a masterpiece of dramatic pacing and<br> 
            musical structure. Other operas followed, including the opera "Falstaff,"<br> 
            based on Shakespeare's play, "The Merry Wives of Windsor."<br>
            <br>
            Verdi died on January 27, 1901 at the age of 88.<br>
