            &emsp;&emsp; This assignment proved to be a much more difficult task then I anticipated. I knew it would be a challenge to get familiar with html and CSS coding again after having not used them is several months, but that wasn't what proved to be difficult...at first that is. The first difficult task was fully grasping what the CSS frameworks were. The course video made them appear to be grab and go code sheets that I could just pick which one I wanted, copy the code into visual studio and then add my details, like a pre-made template in MS Word. That still might be the case, but I could never figure out how to do that. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;What I found is that these frameworks are much more sophisticated than I realized, and I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what these frameworks can provide for a website.  Alas, after watching several tutorial videos, including how to download and install them, I choose Foundation framework. It had a sleek presentation format, easily downloadable system, and lots of tech support.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp; I began by building a rough draft of the assignment within the Foundation framework, with a plan that once I got the hang of everything, to cut and paste the stuff I wanted to keep into new HTML  and CSS files in my project folder. The Foundation framework comes with a pre-built HTML and empty CSS style sheet for me to add my components too.  For the rough draft I used a combination of my previous HTML projects and examples online to get the ball rolling. It took several different approaches to build the grid how I wanted to before I settled on using the grid-area-template command. This approach game me a visual component to my code that allowed me to see how everything should be laid out. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;The coding syntax came back easily and all was going well until I attempted create the navigation menu. There were lots of examples online on how to turn a nav menu horizontal and all the stylings you can add to it. I was able to get the menu to extend horizontal but not all the way to the end of the web page as our assignment directed us to. The links would extend about halfway across the page before doubling on top of each other. I tried multiple different gird areas and alignments, used background coloring to see where areas began and ended. The result was always the same my nav area despite me setting the container grid-area-template to nav across all columns never extended more than halfway across the page. I was stumped for several days. Until eventually I realized it came down to a small coding issue in that despite me defining the #menu and ul and li as part of the nav grid area, I overlooked assigning the nav id itself to the nav grid area I had created in the grid-area-template. As soon as I did that everything then begin to fall in place. I quickly finished my home page and begin the process of saving the foundation framework and the files I had created to my project folder. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;It then only took some trial and error to figure out the best way to shape my first composer page. Once it was complete it was easy to cut and paste my html code to each composer’s html file and assign it the composer.css file I styled to go along with it. Then I ensured the texts and pictures were correct for each composer. I went from defeated to exuberant in a matter of hours as I had finally solved the problem that had been plaguing me for days and had pretty much finished the assignment. <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Take aways from this assignment for me include similar to C# and visual studio 2022, there are lots of resources out there to create almost anything you want with html/css and Visual studio code. You just have to experiment and play around with the different codes and stylings to find what you want. I also found It can be more difficult to find what is causing your problem in html since it is a markup language and Visual studio isn’t looking for potential misspellings or layout issues. It will just ignore something if your syntax is not correct and still present to the webpage whatever is correct. Last, like almost all problems I have faced in learning to code, the smallest issues cause the biggest headaches. Large issues are quicker to recognize and begin to problem solve. Small issues like my nav issue can be very difficult to recognize and address right away.  But push on and persevere. <br>
